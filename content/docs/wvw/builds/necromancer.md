# Necromancer

GW2Mists lists [two necromancer builds](https://gw2mists.com/builds/necromancer): a scourge and a reaper. But below are two other builds to consider.

## Condi Scourge (Backline)

Your main goal is to spam conditions on the enemies with your AoE attacks with staff and sand shades. Use your wells/serpent siphon along with F5 (Shroud) when tag asks for bombs. Keep your staff marks on walls when we’re sieging. Use scepter 3 (devouring darkness) off cooldown to remove boons from enemies. When attacking with scepter make sure to complete the attack chain on 1 to finish applying all conditions.

Use Trail of Anguish as a stun break or extra stability when pushing into an enemy zerg.

### Weapons

Can use focus instead of torch for extra boon strip, but at a large DPS loss.

### Armor

Swap in pieces of trailblazer’s for extra survivability based on preference (or vice versa).

### Alternate Rune Sets

* Thorns
* Afflicted
* Nightmare

### Utility Slots

* Spectral Grasp to yoink people off walls
* Well of Suffering instead of Serpent Siphon for an extra bomb – lose boon strip for more damage.

## Power Scourge (Frontline)

Spend most of your time in axe/focus, use 3 (Unholy Feast) and 5 (Spinal Shivers) off cooldown to continuously be removing boons. Use focus 4 (Soul Grasp) when low on life force. Spam your sand shades on the enemy and use F4 to give yourself extra fury and quickness.

When tag calls for bombs, drop your wells and F5. Use Lich Form typically on the second push to finish off the remaining enemies. Spam 1 in Lich Form for massive damage and use 3 to grant yourself extra fury and quickness.

Keep your staff marks on walls when we’re sieging.

Use Trail of Anguish as a stun break or extra stability when pushing into an enemy zerg.

### Utility Slots

* Spectral Grasp to yoink people off walls.
* Can use Dessicate along with Ghastly Breach if you are skilled enough to be able to get in and out of the zerg.

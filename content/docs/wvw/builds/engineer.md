# Engineer

[GW2Mists lists two workable engineer builds](https://gw2mists.com/builds/engineer): heal scrapper and power scrapper.

## Heal Scrapper (Frontline)

[Frontline Med-Kit Scrapper](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?PeQAIlNUw8yZPMH2JeyTmtKA-zVJYjRBfZEUBUdC47hIAbgHA-w)

You serve five important functions: stealth, mitigate damage, cleanse, heal, and revive.

### Stealth

When commander calls for stealth, use your elite skill Sneak Gyro, which drops a smoke field. Then use your Medkit 5 skill Infusion Bomb, which is a blast finisher.

**Pro tip:** Double tap Medkit 5 first, then click Sneak Gyro, since Infusion Bomb has a small delay to blast. Then swap to Elixir Gun and hit trigger 4. If you change weapons (~) at the right time, the blast will still happen but you won't be thrown backwards. Practice makes perfect!

### Mitigate Damage

**When face to face with the enemy:**

* Skill: Bulwark Gyro (Lightning Field)
* Hammer 4: Shock Shield (Barrier Increase + Vulnerability)
* Hammer 2: Electro-Whirl (Whirl Finisher = Vulnerability)

Then, as needed, use Tool Belt F4: Defense Field (if FB stab gets cleansed or just in a pinch).

** Pro tip:** If full stealth isn’t available or there isn’t time before combat, you can also drop Sneak Gyro followed by Hammer 2: Electro-Whirl (Whirl Finisher) upon engaging the enemy to apply blind (next attack misses).


**Associated Specialization Choices:**

* Inventions: Overshield - Reduced shield recharge + more protection (Backline Option: Automated Med Response - If you spend most of your time in MedKit)
* Alchemy: Protection Injection - When you’ve lost all your stability (Oh No!) (Backline Option: Health Insurance - Increased med kit healing)
* Scrapper: Damage Dampener - Damage taken is delayed and spread out more
* Scrapper: Adaptive Armor - Better barrier + damage reduction (Backline Option: Applied Force - Quickness to help with heal recharge if that’s your main focus)

### Cleanse

**Combo Cleanses:**

* Skill: Purge Gyro (Light Field)

PLUS FINISHER (Light + Finisher = Cleanse)

* Med-Kit 5 Infusion Bomb (Blast Finisher) Slight delay: best when standing still
* Hammer 2 Electro-whirl (Whirl Finisher) Instant: best on the go

**Aimed Cleanses:**

* Elixir Gun 3 (Cone Cleanse)

**Associated Specialization Choices:**

* Alchemy: Comeback Cure - Grant Regeneration on cleanse
* Alchemy: Purity of Purpose - Convert Conditions to Boons

### Heal

**Combo Heals:**

* Elixir Gun 5: Super Elixir (Light Field)

PLUS FINISHER (Water + Finisher = Heal)

* Med-Kit 5 Infusion Bomb (Blast Finisher) Slight delay: best when standing still
* Hammer 2 Electro-whirl (Whirl Finisher) Instant: best on the go

**Aimed Heal:**

* Med Kit 1: Med Blaster
* Med Kit 2: Bandage Blast

**Area Heal:**

* Med Kit 4: Vital Burst
* Tool Kit F2: Healing Mist

**Self Heal:**

* Tool Kit F1: Bandage Self (Also heals allies with associated specialization choices below)

**Associated Specialization Choices:**

* Inventions: Soothing Detonation - Heal allies when using tool belt skills
* Inventions: Medical Dispersion Field - Shared self heal

### Revive

Tool Belt F5: Function Gyro (Lightning Field) is used to revive allies or finish enemies. It's a targeted skill, so you can drop it without leaving tag, or you can use it in conjunction with manual reviving to speed the process. It can also be finished with varying results based on finisher (see [the Combo page on the wiki](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Combo) for more information).
